## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Python 3.7 or higher.
- You have a basic understanding of Jupyter notebooks and Python programming.
- You have `pip` installed.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone 

https://github.com/Tvishak16/Lung-Cancer-detection.git

cd lung_cancer_prediction
```

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Notebook:**
   Open the `lung_cancer.ipynb` notebook in your Jupyter interface.

3. **Run the Cells:**
   Execute the cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the models, and visualize the results.
